Fully evolved Cobblemon can be spawned with: 
```
/pokespawn <name> alpha
```
Currently there are alpha eyes in place for all Gen1 and Gen2 Cobblemon

## Features
- Any fully evolved Cobblemon has a 1/4 chance of spawning as an alpha
- All Alpha Cobblemon are 1.25x bigger
- All Alpha Cobblemon spawn with 3 perfect IVs
- All Alpha Cobblemon will roar and start attacking players that come too close

### Upcoming
- Gen3 Cobblemon Alpha eyes (planned for v3)
- Alpha music will play (Planned for v3)
- Alpha Cobblemon will spawn with a herd (Planned for v3)

## Contributing

All help is welcome! Especially sprite work, making emissive red eyes for every mon takes a while. You can view the current state of development [here](https://github.com/WesselvanGils/CobblemonAlphas/milestones).
