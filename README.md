# [Early Access] Cobblemon Alphas

The current state of the project is that it's in Alpha. The bsic logic is in place and any fully evolved pokemon can be spawned with: 
```
/pokespawn <name> alpha
```
Currently there are alpha eyes in place for all 151 original pokemon

## Having cobblemon attack players

To actually fight the mons use [Fight or Fligh Reborn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon-fight-or-flight-reborn) and set
- `"do_pokemon_attack_unprovoked": true`
- `"always_aggro_aspects": ["alpha"]`

in the config

## Contributing

All help is welcome! Especially sprite work, making emissive red eyes for every mon takes a while. You can view the current state of development [here](https://github.com/WesselvanGils/CobblemonAlphas/milestones).
